                        Here in COVENANT FAITHLIFE ASSEMBLY INC, NEW COVENANT HOUSE, God has commissioned us to Restoring you to your ORIGINAL POSITION OF COVENANT DOMINION through the DOING and the TEACHING of the word of faith.
                        We believe the FULL GOSPEL from Genesis to the book of Revelation. We believe in the Holy Spirit as the 3rd person in trinity) and His manifestation even in the present dispensation till Christ returns. We believe that God has a definite purpose for your life as an individual and as a missionary, it is only in doing the word of God that you can accomplish your mission on earth righteously.
                        We believe that our church, Covenant FaithLife Assembly Inc. New Covenant House has been called by God as part of the end time move of the Holy Spirit to revealing Christ and empower the saints for exploits, to teach and prepare the David’s Army that will enthrone the king, our Lord Jesus Christ in righteousness as David was enthroned by all Israel at the fullness of time.
                        Covenant Faithlife Assembly Inc; is a church committed to the healing of the total man touching your Spirit, Soul and Body thus restoring the tripartite man to his original position of dominion on earth while conforming to the image of Christ 
                        We believe that taking dominion on earth in righteousness is a matter of the choice you make  since God has given us all things that pertains unto life and Godliness (II Peter 1:3) and that his covenant is not established in your life when you make a contrary choice of not taking dominion in every department of your life (DEUT.8:18)Thus all that the  Lord demands from you is to agree with what he had said concerning you in absolute faith that works by love for  Him (Gal5:6, John 14 :15)

                        ALL OF GOD’S PROMISE IN THE BIBLE ARE HIS COVENANT WORDS TO US SEALED BY THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST 
                        Hebrew 12:24(KJV) “And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant and to the blood of sprinkling, 
                        that speaketh better things than that of Abel. The paraphrased living Bible puts it this way.. “And to Jesus himself who has brought this wonderful NEW AGREEMENT; and to the sprinkled blood which graciously forgive instead of crying out for vengeance as the blood of Abel did.” Simply put,
                        living within the ambits of this covenant means a determination to abide by its terms
                        You are not permitted by reasons of the ORIGINAL PURPOSE OF GOD for your life to conform to the world but rather be transformed by the 
                        COVENANT WORD OF GOD to conform to the image of Christ in other to DOMINATE and TRANSFORM YOUR WORLD
